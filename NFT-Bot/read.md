#### Project Description
Provide a clear statement of the challenges/issues/problems/gaps your project engages as well as a brief, high-level description of how your project engages the areas you've identified. What is the value of your approach? Who are the intended users?

Fasty, is a virtual assistant that connects users with NFTs from marketplace such as OpenSea & Rarible, through conversational experiences in top Messaging Apps such as Telegram.

Our goal is to accelerate the mass adoption of NFTs by Users, Merchants and Peers, through a shopping assistant in Messaging Apps, such as Telegram, Meta & Web.

Why Messaging Apps? In 2020, an estimate of **2.77 billion mobile phone users**, already had installed in their smartphones the top messaging apps to communicate. This could help us accelerate the mass adoption of NFTs, since the users won't need to install a new App.
